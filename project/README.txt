You probably want truthesis.zip which contains everything here:

LogoHbwTRU.eps        -- encapsulated postscript version of the TRU logo
LogoHbwTRU.pdf        -- PDF version of the TRU logo (in case you use pdflatex)
documentation.pdf     -- the manual
truthesis.cls         -- the LaTeX class file itself
truthesis_example.tex -- an example/template that uses the class
